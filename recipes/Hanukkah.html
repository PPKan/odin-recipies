    <img src="../images/Hanukkah-Star-Challah-Finished.jpeg" alt="This is images of Hanukkah star challah">

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 ⅔ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or more if desired</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 1 cup of water, eggs, salt, sugar, bread flour, and yeast 
            into the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the 
            manufacturer. Select the Dough setting, and start the machine.</li>
        <li>When cycle is completed, remove dough from the machine, and set 
            onto a floured work surface for 15 minutes to rest. Cover dough 
            with a towel or large bowl to prevent drying out.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough several times, and cut into 6 equal pieces. Roll 
            each piece out into a rope about 10 inches long and 1 inch in diameter.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay 3 ropes of bread 
            onto the prepared baking sheet, and pinch ropes together firmly 
            at the ends to form a pointed triangle. Weave 3 more ropes over 
            and underneath each point of the first triangle to make a second, 
            interwoven triangle. Pinch it closed tightly at the edges to make 
            a 6-pointed star. Set the baking sheet in a warm place, and allow 
            to rise until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk egg yolk 
            with 1 tablespoon of water, and brush the mixture over the loaf; 
            sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the challah is shiny, golden brown, 
            and sounds hollow when tapped, about 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
